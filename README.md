  <b>A Cybersecurity Research & Educational Password Testing Tool</b><br>
  <i>For Authorized Use Only – Simulate, Learn, and Defend</i>
</p>

---

## ⚡ Overview

**InstaPassBy** is an educational toolkit built to help **security researchers, red teamers, and educators** understand password security mechanisms and simulate password-testing scenarios **in controlled, authorized environments**.

🧠 Its primary goal is to:
- Demonstrate how password-strength policies and brute-force protection work.
- Teach secure password-handling concepts.
- Provide a *safe* playground for cybersecurity experimentation.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This project is strictly for **authorized, educational, or research use**.  
> Unauthorized usage **is illegal and unethical**. See the [Legal & Ethical Notice](#⚖️-legal--ethical-notice) below.

## 🧩 Features

✅ **Demo Mode** – fully simulated target for safe local testing  
✅ **Lab Mode** – for use in authorized penetration test labs only  
✅ **Custom Wordlists** and configurable throttling  
✅ **Detailed Logs & Reports** (JSON / CSV exports)  
✅ **SIEM & Analytics Hooks**  
✅ **Safe Defaults** (throttled rate limits, demo mode on by default)  
✅ **CI/CD Compatible** (run demo tests automatically)

## 🧱 Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| 🛡️ **Safety First** | Runs in `--demo` mode by default — never targets live systems without explicit flags. |
| 🔍 **Transparency** | All actions are logged for auditability. |
| ⚙️ **Configurability** | Everything can be tuned via CLI or YAML config. |
| 📊 **Accountability** | Detailed logging and timestamped records. |

## ⚙️ Requirements

- 🐍 **Python 3.10+**
- 📦 Dependencies (example):
  ```text
  requests
  rich
  pytest




🧱 Demo Mode (Safe & Default)

Run in simulation mode (no network activity):

python instapassby.py --demo --wordlist sample_wordlist.txt


🟢 Safe Mode: Simulates password-checking responses locally.
No connections to external systems. Ideal for workshops and training.


🧰 Authorized Lab Mode

Run against a controlled lab environment (with explicit written permission):

python instapassby.py --lab \
  --target http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --wordlist my_lab_wordlist.txt \
  --confirm-authorized


🔴 Warning: The --confirm-authorized flag is required and serves as your acknowledgment of explicit permission.
